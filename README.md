## Hi! üëã
I'm an Information and System Technology Student at Bandung Institute of Technology. My long-term interest is in DS/AI, specifically in the bioinformatics field. However, as of right now, I usually experiment with various tech stacks and different aspects of web development. Most of the repositories uploaded here are my group projects for university, although occasionally I do my own fun side projects.

### ‚≠ê Things I'm Comfortable Using:
- Python
- JS (React, Next.js, Express)
- HTML/CSS (for static web)
- Various DBMS (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.)
- GitHub/GitLab
  
I have also used, but not proficient in C and Java.
I'm planning to learn more about data warehousing, data processing at a large scale, ML, and things related to computational biology.
